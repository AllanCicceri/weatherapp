App developed with React + React-Icons + Styled Components + OpenWeather API.

Things learned: 
Problem about using state on an input suggestion box with text filtered on change time: it's 
async!! 

First time I used useRef, not sure is good pratice but not having to pass the event action through all
the functions seems to me a way to clean the code.

Used Styled Components for the first time to change background image, it was pretty easy
and the code pretty clean. With pure css probably would have more work.

I've tested deploy to netlify, but it got too slow to start.
Then I've tried Vercel and it is a bit slow yet, but much better than the first option. Link to
