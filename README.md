App developed with React + React-Icons + Styled Components + OpenWeather API.

Things learned: problem about using state on an input suggestion box with text filtered on change time: it's 
async!!

User Styled Components for the first time to change background image, it was pretty easy
and the code pretty clean. With pure css probably would have more work.

I've tested deploy to netlify, but it got too slow to start.

Then I've tried Vercel and it is a bit slow yet, but much better than the other option. Link to
